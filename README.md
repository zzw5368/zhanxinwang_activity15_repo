# zhanxinwang_activity15_repo


This Activity #15 Repository for STAT 184 is for practicing using GitHub.  
It contains a project from the previous assignment (Activity #14), where the goal was to create a Quarto document (QMD) that renders a PDF. That document includes data wrangling and visualizations that help interpret the Armed Forces dataset, the Baby Names dataset, and the Box Problem.

## Data Sources

All data used in the QMD file is public:

1. **Armed Forces Data (June 2025):**  
   https://neilhatfield.github.io/Stat184_PayGradeRanks.html  
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19xQn1cBh6JKw7eP8YQuuicMlVDF7G-nXCb5qbwb_E/edit?gid=597536282#gid=597536282

2. **Baby Names Data:**  
   `dcData` package in R

## Current Plan

My plan for this assignment is to practice using GitHub. I’ve used GitHub before, but I want to practice all the other features such as branches and issues as well.

I will also revise my QMD file from Activity #14 so that everything meets STAT 184 assignment requirements. This includes formatting of the QMD and the rendered PDF file.

I plan to create:
- An organized GitHub repository  
- Correct use of issues for task tracking  
- A **dev branch** for revisions  
- Clean commit messages  
- A main branch that only stores finished work  

I will also make sure the QMD is runnable directly from this repository using only public data sources.
