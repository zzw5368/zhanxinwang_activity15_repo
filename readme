# zhan_activity15_repo

This Activity #15 Repository for the class STAT 184 aims to be practice using GitHub. It contains a project from a previous assignment (Activity #14), where the goal was to create a Quarto document (QMD) that will be rendered as a PDF. That document includes data wrangling and visualizations that help interpret the Armed Forces dataset, the Baby Names dataset, and the Box Problem.

## Data Sources

All the data used in the QMD file is public:

1. Armed Forces Data (June 2025):  
   https://neilhatfield.github.io/Stat184_PayGradeRanks.html  
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19xQnI1cBh6Jkw7eP8YQuuicMlVDF7Gr-nXCb5qbwb_E/edit?gid=597536282#gid=597536282

2. Baby Names Data: `dcData` package on R

## Current Plan

My current plan for this assignment is to be able to practice using GitHub. I’ve used GitHub previously, but plan to practice all the other features such as branches and issues as well. Through this GitHub practice, I also plan to revise my QMD file from Activity #14 so that everything meets the assignment requirements. This mostly includes formatting of the QMD / rendered PDF file, as most of the code revisions have been done in the previous assignment.

I plan to create an organized GitHub repository, correctly using issues to track tasks, learning to use branches before merging to main, and making clear and meaningful commit messages. I will also make sure the QMD is able to run as is from this repository on someone else’s computer, with only public and accessible data sources that are correctly documented.
